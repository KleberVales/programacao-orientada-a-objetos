# 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which represent real-world entities. Each object combines data (attributes) and behavior (methods), promoting a modular, reusable, and maintainable structure.

## 🔑 Core Concepts
**Class:** The blueprint or template that defines the characteristics and behaviors of objects.
Example: class Car { ... }

**Object:** An instance of a class — a functional copy based on the blueprint.
Example: Car myCar = new Car();

**Encapsulation:** Protects the internal data of an object by exposing only what’s necessary through public methods.\
→ Helps maintain data security and integrity.
