# 🧠 Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which represent real-world entities. Each object combines data (attributes) and behavior (methods), promoting a modular, reusable, and maintainable structure.

## 🔑 Core Concepts
**Class:** The blueprint or template that defines the characteristics and behaviors of objects.
Example: class Car { ... }

**Object:** An instance of a class — a functional copy based on the blueprint.
Example: Car myCar = new Car();

**Encapsulation:** Protects the internal data of an object by exposing only what’s necessary through public methods.\
→ Helps maintain data security and integrity.

**Inheritance:** Allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.\
→ Example: class ElectricCar extends Car

**Polymorphism:** Enables methods with the same name to behave differently depending on the object’s type or context.\
→ Example: method overriding (@Override in Java).

**Abstraction:** Focuses on the essential aspects of an object while hiding unnecessary implementation details.\
→ Example: using abstract classes and methods.

## ⚙️ Benefits of OOP
- More organized and modular code
- Reusability of components
- Easier maintenance and extension
- Greater clarity and connection to real-world concepts
